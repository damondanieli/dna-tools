DNA Tools that work on AncestryDNA/Promethease files.

## DNA data

This directory is currently ignored from Git so you can put working files there and they will not be committed.

I recommend unzipping the DNA file downloaded from your site (in my case AncestryDNA.com) and moving the AncestryDNA.txt file to something like "dna/damon.dna".
The tools in the bin directory will expect a file in this format:

```

#Genetic data is provided below as five TAB delimited columns.  Each line 
#corresponds to a SNP.  Column one provides the SNP identifier (rsID where 
#possible).  Columns two and three contain the chromosome and basepair position 
#of the SNP using human reference build 37.1 coordinates.  Columns four and five 
#contain the two alleles observed at this SNP (genotype).  The genotype is reported 
#on the forward (+) strand with respect to the human reference.
rsid	chromosome	position	allele1	allele2

## Installing Promethease files

Copy your promethease files into the promethease directory.

You should have a promethease/promethease.html file.
